A java project that solve the np-hard vehicle routing problem with the help of a evolutionary algorithm
### What is it for (at the time) ###
The project is for the seminar evolutionary algorithm from the college HTWK Leipzig in Germany. I have to submit this project in mid of february. Till the 18.02 I will only work on the output and the algorithm, because I needed the data for the seminar.

It is a very early version for testing only online.
### The future steps ###
  * The next steps will be to restructure the code, make it more comfortable and easier to read.
  * After that I woult like to add a GUI to this project so anybody can easier put some data to the algorithm and see the result more easier.
  * In the future I will add some more vehicle routing problems(vrp) like multi depot vrp or multi periodic vrp.

So feel free to leave a comment and download my source code :)
